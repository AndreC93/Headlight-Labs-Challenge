# Mars Mining Discovery Tournament


## My approach

I went with a vanilla JavaScript approach because it seemed like the fastest way to get started. I like to start simply
and make things more complicated over time.

I started out by...

## Tradeoffs I made

I decided to do X because it seemed like the fastest way to get going, and time was a factor obviously.

Though Framework Z is popular, I decided not to use it because I didn't feel like I was familiar enough to implement
everything in time.

## Future goals

With more time I would've implemented:
   * Feature A, because it would've been really informative
   * Feature B, because I think it's really cool.

Feature A would've taken roughly another 30 minutes I think, but would add a lot more information. Still, I didn't want to ignore the write-up to implement feature A,
so I decided to leave it out.

Feature B is a much longer investment, but I think it'd be really cool because of reasons X,Y,Z.
